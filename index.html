                <h2>January brings us firefox 85</h2>
                <p>To wrap up January, we are proud to bring you the release of Firefox 85. In this version we are
                    bringing
                    you support for the :focus-visible pseudo-class in CSS and associated devtools, and the complete
                    removal
                    of Flash support from Firefox.

            <h2>Top 3 jobs</h2>
            <p>The release of Apple Silicon-based Macs at the end of last year generated a flurry of news coverage and
                some surprises at the machine’s performance. This post details some background information on the
                experience of porting Firefox to run natively on these CPUs.</p>
            <p>We’ll start with some background on the Mac transition and give an overview of Firefox internals that
                needed to know about the new architecture, before moving on to the concept of Universal Binaries.</p>
            <p>We’ll then explain how DRM/EME works on the new platform, talk about our experience with macOS Big Sur,
                and discuss various updater problems we had to deal with. We’ll conclude with the release and an
                overview of various other improvements that are in the pipeline.</p>

                <p>This button would add a box to the row of key content boxes below the intro text. This should put the

                <h2>Another site</h2>
                <p>I'd suggest having a popup that asks where in the row to insert the box (at the beginning or end),
                    what title to give the box, what text to put in the box, and where the box should link to. The
                    entire box should serve as a link to the destination page.

                <p>You can also include a type attribute containing the MIME type of the resource, so a browser can
                    quickly see what resources are on offer, and ignore ones that it doesn’t support.
